            <p>Colors</p>
            
            <p>Based in San Diego, here at Colors we provide you with statement furniture that will be as fun and exciting as you are. Our company is based on premium craftsmanship and quality. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Colors supplies furniture for the fun person in the friend group. The one who wears all yellow outfits and dyes their hair to match. Whether you feel like that on the inside or showcase it on the outside, we have furniture that matches your personality. If you're tired of buying black, brown, and grey furniture, we are here for you. </p>
           
            <p>Our primary goal is to sell furniture that people will love and will get questions on every time they have visitors. We want to preach that your furniture is not limited to three colors! The colors of the rainbow belong on our pieces. </p>
